A maze game. *currently incomplete*

This was originally a game I wrote in Java.  I've been wanting to learn more javascript.  I know basic stuff and can get by with debugging it but wanted more experience, especially with HTML5 canvas.  

The game generates a random maze for the user to solve.  It will keep track of how much time it took.  Boring, but it's a start.
